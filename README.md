# QEMU for Xilinx Development on MSYS2

## Introduction

This repository provides an MSYS2 infrastructure setup specifically tailored for Xilinx developers. It includes a pre-compiled version of QEMU optimized for Xilinx architectures, enabling seamless development and testing within a Windows environment using MSYS2. Additionally, all relevant device trees are pre-compiled and ready to use.

## Features

- **Pre-compiled QEMU for Xilinx**: Ready-to-use QEMU binaries optimized for Xilinx ARM and MicroBlaze architectures.
- **Pre-compiled Device Trees**: Includes pre-compiled device trees for various Xilinx boards and configurations.
- **MSYS2 Environment**: A comprehensive Unix-like environment on Windows, tailored for Xilinx development.
- **Xilinx Toolchain Integration**: Seamless integration with Xilinx SDK and Vivado for streamlined development workflows.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed instructions and examples for setting up and using the MSYS2 environment with QEMU for Xilinx.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later.
- **MSYS2**: Download and install MSYS2 from [msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org/).

### Steps

1. **Install MSYS2**

    Follow the instructions on the [MSYS2 website](https://www.msys2.org/) to install MSYS2.

2. **Update MSYS2**

    Open the MSYS2 terminal and update the package database and core system packages:

    ```bash
    pacman -Syu
    ```

3. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codedidim/QEMU.git
    cd QEMU
    ```

4. **Install Required Packages**

    Install the necessary packages for QEMU and Xilinx development:

    ```bash
    pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-qemu
    ```

5. **Set Up Environment Variables**

    Add the QEMU binaries to your PATH:

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/qemu-xilinx/bin
    ```

6. **Verify Installation**

    Ensure QEMU is correctly installed by running:

    ```bash
    qemu-system-arm --version
    ```

## Usage

### Running a Simple Example

1. **Prepare Your Xilinx Project**

    Compile your Xilinx project using the Xilinx SDK or Vivado.

2. **Launch QEMU**

    Use the following command to launch QEMU with your compiled project and pre-compiled device tree:

    ```bash
    qemu-system-arm -M xilinx-zynq-a9 -kernel <path_to_your_kernel> -dtb <path_to_precompiled_dtb> -serial mon:stdio
    ```

3. **Interact with the Emulated System**

    You can interact with your emulated Xilinx system through the QEMU console.

### Available Device Trees

The repository includes pre-compiled device trees for various Xilinx boards. You can find them in the `device_trees` directory. Here are some examples:

- **zcu100-**: `/c/qemu/build/qemu-devicetrees/LATEST/MULTI_ARCH/zcu100-arm.dtb`
- **Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC**: `/c/qemu/build/qemu-devicetrees/LATEST/MULTI_ARCH//ultra96-arm.dtb`

### Advanced Configuration

For advanced configurations, refer to the [QEMU Documentation](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/) and Xilinx-specific examples in the `docs` directory of this repository.
